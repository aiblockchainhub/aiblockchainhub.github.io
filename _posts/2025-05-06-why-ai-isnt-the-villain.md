Let’s get one thing straight: **AI isn’t here to take over. It’s here to reflect us.**

The fear around AI replacing jobs is valid, sure. But the real threat?  
Us humans refusing to adapt.

AI is a mirror — it learns from us, our biases, our brilliance, our chaos.  
So maybe the better question is: _Are we ready to meet ourselves?_

Spoiler: We still have time. But not if we keep watching 9-hour productivity videos and calling it "research."
