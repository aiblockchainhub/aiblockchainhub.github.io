There’s a weird overlap between debugging code and figuring out your 20s.

You try something. It breaks.  
You Google the error. Try StackOverflow.  
You think you’ve fixed it — then boom, another exception.

That’s basically life after 25.

I don’t have all the answers.  
But writing helps. Coding helps.  
And maybe this blog helps me (and you) feel a little less stuck.

Here’s to debugging life, one `console.log()` at a time.
