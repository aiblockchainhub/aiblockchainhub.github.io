So you're curious about using the Chirpy theme? Good choice.

Here's how I set it up on GitHub Pages like a boss:

1. Fork the repo [`cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy`](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
2. Rename it to `yourusername.github.io`
3. Edit `_config.yml` (title, description, bio, etc.)
4. Push changes. Boom — your blog is live.

If it feels confusing at first, that’s totally normal.  
Jekyll’s like that one moody genius friend — hard to get, but powerful once you click.
