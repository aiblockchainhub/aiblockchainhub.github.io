description: A short welcome to AI & Blockchain Hub — tech musings, code experiments, and occasional chaos.
---

Hey there, digital wanderer 👋

Welcome to **AI & Blockchain Hub**, my little corner on the web. This blog is a space for:

- Dev logs and coding experiments  
- Deep dives into AI and blockchain  
- Random tech rants  
- And occasional existential oversharing

I’m ZapGrid, and I code not just for a living — but also to make sense of this absurd reality.  
Stay tuned for the chaos.
